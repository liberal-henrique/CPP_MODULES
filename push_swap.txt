	Push_swap is a project develop in C language. The objective is to implement our own
sorting algorythm which must be limited to two stacks of integers to 3, 5, 100 and 500 elements. 
The mandatory limit the number of possible moviments, they will be listed above, 
and just to stack. I choose to group these two stacks in two linked lists avoinding 
demanding to move all of my elements in an array.
I choosed to implement the mid-sort algorythm. 


It consisted in break divide
my stack in two parts all the time
